# Chemical 3D Structures

## Overview

The **chemical-3d-structures** project aims to provide a user-friendly platform for students to visualize and explore 3D chemical structures. This tool is designed to enhance the learning experience for students studying chemistry by offering an interactive way to view molecular structures in three dimensions.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Visualization:** Utilize an intuitive interface to manipulate and inspect chemical structures in three dimensions.
- **Molecule Database:** Access a diverse set of chemical compounds with detailed 3D representations. Form `https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov`
